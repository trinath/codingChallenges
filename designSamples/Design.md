# Design Expectations
* The problems can be wide and bottomless, and the point of the interview is to see how much volume you can cover in 45 minutes. 
* For the most part, you‘ll be steering the conversation. It‘s up to you to understand the problem. 
* That might mean asking questions, sketching diagrams on the board, and bouncing ideas off your interviewer. 
* Do you know the constraints? What kind of inputs does your system need to handle? You have to get a sense for the scope of the problem 
  before you start exploring the space of possible solutions. And remember, there is no single right answer to a real-world problem.
* The following things are checked. a) Abstractions b) Separation of Concerns c) Extensibility of Design d) Concurrency e) Client/Server
  Interaction f) System Design Patterns. 

# Desing Excerpts
- Finite State Machine Implementation. 
  * (one start state and multiple end states.)
  * It should be extensible, adding any number of states and any number of transitions.
  * should be able to set notifications on or off to any state.
  > Soution: Use state design pattern. 
- Implement Bidding System in Flipkart.
- Design an elevator system, improvise it to multiple elevators with single button on each floor.
- Design Snakes & Ladders game.
